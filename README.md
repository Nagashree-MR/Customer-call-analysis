# Call Center Performance Dashboard

## Overview

This project features an interactive Microsoft Excel dashboard built to analyze **call center performance at the representative level**. It allows users to drill down into individual rep metrics, helping supervisors assess productivity, identify top performers, and spot improvement opportunities — all within a clean and intuitive interface.

## Key Insights Provided

- **📈 Total Calls Handled**: Track how many customer interactions each rep managed.
- **🕒 Call Duration Analysis**: Understand average call lengths for efficiency assessment.
- **😊 Customer Satisfaction**: Visual representation of feedback scores by rep.
- **⏰ Time Distribution**: Identify peak call hours and rep availability.
- **📞 Call Type Breakdown**: Analyze call types — Inbound, Outbound, and Follow-ups.

## Why This Dashboard Stands Out

- Built **entirely in Excel** using Pivot Tables, Charts, and Slicers
- Clickable filters for real-time, rep-specific insights
- No coding or external tools required — simple, powerful, and accessible
- Ideal for team leads and managers to:
  - Monitor team workload
  - Compare performance metrics
  - Recognize top performers
  - Target coaching for underperformers

## Project Structure

- **Call centre performance dashboard/** – Contains the `.xlsx` file with the working dashboard

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers)
- Git & GitHub for version control
